<p>In the past twelve years, I've lived in ten countries across three continents. I've left breadcrumbs of my views and experiences scattered around in different digital spaces. I started with <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi5”> Hi5</a>, later used <a href=”https://www.feedough.com/does-myspace-still-exist-why-did-myspace-fail/”>MySpace</a>, followed by Facebook, then Twitter, and later Instagram.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, as I kept moving from country to country, many friends suggested I started a blog. I contemplated the idea a few times, but self-doubt always won. Ironically, for someone who makes her living mostly by writing, I wondered if anything I had to say had any value.</p>
<h4>When in deep self-doubt, excuses are excellent tools for self-sabotage</h4>
<p>For years, I thought I needed a cool-looking site to start writing because I was always told it's imperative to make a great first impression.</p>
<p>That thought was the seed I used to grow my tree of excuses:</p>
<ul class="list">
        <li>Oh, I don't have enough money to pay a web designer to do a sassy website that projects my personality.</li><br>
        <li>Yikes, what's this hosting stuff? Paying for a domain, why, what's that? Oh, that's pricey.</li><br>
        <li>Ah, but look at the free website templates. I can't find anything that says "me."</li><br>
        <li>Gosh, what a busy week; my brain is mush, I can't think, let's drink wine and binge watch a TV show to give my brain cells a well-deserved break. (Repeat this every time the little voice in your head whispers, <em>you know you want it and can do it, and this weekend you've got the time to plan it out…</em> Drown her with Malbec! It's such a tangy, fruity, full-bodied way to hinder any productivity.)</li><br>
        <li>There's absolutely nothing interesting I can write about because I'm not that interesting. Anyways, I thought about this idea, but I noticed that this famous journalist already wrote similar in this big-shot publication, so, bummer, why bother, it's already been said and done.</li>
      </ul>
<p>But it's never really about any of these points, right?</p>
<p>I lacked confidence in myself. I feared that people would find whatever I wrote disappointing at best, a total waste of their time at worst. So, after years of pondering whether to blog or not to blog, my self-doubt won.</p>
<h4>New skills, new possibilities, and second chances</h4>
<p>I've been working in communications for non-profits for the past decade. After years of working with web developers and designers on maintaining, upgrading, or often revamping websites, I decided to learn to code. I thought it would make it easier for me to explain to my non-digital-savvy colleagues how online products work and manage their expectations. I also wanted to better express to developers and designers what we wanted and needed and why.</p>
<p>It took me five years to make the time and save up the money to do so. Last year I completed a coding course.</p>
<p>Learning to code meant that I could no longer riddle my mind with excuses. I finally had the tools and the knowledge to build something that said &quot;me.&quot;</p>
<p>But I didn't want a blog. I wanted to create a space where I could express myself, be creative, a place where I could play, experiment, and improve my coding and design skills.</p>
<p>More importantly, <span class="thick">I wanted to house my own content in one place.</span></p>
<p>In the past, other than my scattered use of social media platforms, I wrote for a few online publications that eventually went offline. I created content and products for some organizations that were deleted during website revamps. <span class="thick">That work is gone.</span> <a href="https://indieweb.org/site-deaths">Dead</a>. I have nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>I also don't like the idea of someone else owning, controlling, or having rights over <em>my</em> content.</p>
<p>After eight months of trials and errors, several screams of frustration in between, and three prolonged work-related breaks, I built my personal publishing space — my <a href="https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse">home on the internet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/about-this-site">It's not where I want it to be yet</a>. But I can only get my site there by making mistakes, tweaking and changing things around, and learning in the process. If I keep waiting for it to be perfect, it'll never get anywhere. Something non-existent can't make any impressions.</p>
<p>As for the self-doubt about my writing, I agree with this opinion:</p>

<p>From now on, this is where I'll be telling and sharing my stories, my thoughts, and what I care about. Seth Godin is right when he <a href="https://seths.blog/2010/11/where-do-ideas-come-from/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[If an idea] merely stays where it is and doesn't join us here, it's hidden. And hidden ideas don't ship, have no influence, no intersection with the market. They die, alone.
