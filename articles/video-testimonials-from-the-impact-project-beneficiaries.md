I shot testimonials and cinematography and procured visuals from project beneficiares. I worked with a freelance videographer on drone takes, post-production, and sound editing. 

Spanish subtitles are available.

The IMPACT Project was a Canada-funded cooperative agriculture initiative to support Colombia's peace process in eleven departments across the country.
