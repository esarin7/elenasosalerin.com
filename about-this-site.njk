      <h3>I'm a rookie developer</h3>
      <p>
        I designed and painstakingly coded each and every bit of this site from scratch using semantic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 
      </p>

      <p>
      I built a simpler-looking version in 2019, though there was nothing simple about learning how to make it responsive. It was a great learning experience which paved the way for this current version.
      </p>

      <p>I still have a lot to learn. Building this site, which I know isn't perfect (yet), is part of my education. I'm confident that I'll be able to improve and refine my front-end developing skills as I learn and practice more.
      </p>

      <h3>Future add-ons and tweaks</h3>
      <p>
      The following are some features or functions I’ll be working on to improve this site:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Add a Github link (once I clean up my repositories and add a profile)</li>
        <li>Add a search function</li>
        <li>Add RSS</li>
        <li>Add social media sharing links and style what is shared</li>
        <li>Add visible tags</li>
        <li>Decide to add webmentions or a comment section</li>
        <li>Improve semantic HMTL</li>
        <li>Optimize images</li>
        <li>Add items to my portfolio page, solve the latest to oldest order display, add supplementary PDFs</li>
        <li>Figure out how to maintain the original style of embedded tweets (my CSS is currently overriding it)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
      
      <p>
      I'm solely responsible for anything you see on this site. Nothing expressed here represents the views of any entity whatsoever with which I have been, am now, or will be affiliated.
      <p>

      <h4>Technical Details</h4>

      <p>
      I built this site with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="blank"> Eleventy, </a> a static site generator (SSG). It's hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="blank">Netlify</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      This website uses third-party fonts from Google: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Domine?query=domine" target="blank">Domine</a> (body) and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto"target="blank">Roboto</a> (headings).
      </p>

      <p>
    I mostly use HTML generated icons shared by <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/symbols/" blank="target">Toptal Designers</a>, but some are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="blank">Fontawesome</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Design and Imagery </h4>

      <p>
      The site's colour pallete is inspired by <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/34015156/AFRO-FUSION-FESTIVAL" target="blank">the work</a> of illustrator and graphic designer, <a href="https://www.cynthia-alonso.com/" target="blank">Cynthia Alonso</a>, whose use of vibrant colours loudly speaks to my heart.
      </p>

      <p>
      Unless otherwise stated, I took all the images featured on this site. Please do not take my images and state them as your own. If you would like to use any of them on your blog or social media, please credit me in the caption and link to this website.
      </p>
