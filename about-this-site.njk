      <h3>I'm a rookie developer.</h3>
      <p>
        I designed and painstakingly coded each and every bit of this site from scratch using semantic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 
      </p>

      <p>Front-end web development is the latest skill I've acquired. I still have a lot to learn. Building this site, which I know isn't perfect, is part of my education. I'm confident that I'll be able to improve and refine it as I learn and practice more.
      </p>

      
        
      <p>This website uses third-party fonts from Google: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Domine?query=domine" target="blank">Domine</a> (body) and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto"target="blank">Roboto</a> (headings).
