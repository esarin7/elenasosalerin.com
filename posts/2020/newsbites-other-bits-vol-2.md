    <p>I'm aiming to post this weekly roundup every Friday morning. But this site is a one-person operation and this week was dizzyingly hectic. I can't wait for the day I get to do this.</p>

#### A weekly edition of content I think you'd like to read, listen to, and watch

Everything that unravelled and keeps unravelling this year, along with the COVID-19 pandemic, seems to have wrought collective emotional devastation. As someone who eagerly consumes news, this year has been challenging ‚Äì some days, it's just too painful and overwhelming to read the headlines, never mind the stories. 

Although we can't control the news around us, we can better manage our intellectual and emotional state of mind to make sense of it all. I've been trying to mix my news consumption with content that sparks my curiosity but also soothes my mind. Other times, I go offline and, weather-permitting, go for a long walk.

These are disorienting times. Sometimes all we can do is take each day as it comes.

<span role="img" aria-label="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> Be kind to yourself and others. Enjoy your weekend.

<span class="thick">Climate change and COVID-19</span>: Two weeks ago, in <a href="https://www.elenasosalerin.com/posts/2020/newsbites-other-bits-vol-1/">my first weekly roundup</a>, I shared a story about how hurricane Eta could unravel a humanitarian crisis in Central America. A few days later, Iota, <a href="https://bit.ly/36WAWCz" target="blank">a second, more destructive hurricane hit the region, especially affecting Honduras</a>. <span class="thick">The Guardian's Jeff Ernst</span> reports that the pandemic, which had already sunk the country's economy, will also be one of many other factors that makes it difficult for the country's government to receive much needed foreign aid, as the global community‚Äôs attention is focused on their own pandemic responses. <span class="thick">The Intercept's Sandra Cuffe</span> highlights the life-altering <a href="https://bit.ly/396fs9c " target="blank">challenges and losses of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala's indigenous populations</a> after the hurricanes.<br>
<br>
Natural phenomena like these hurricanes are a direct result of <span class="thick">climate change</span>.
As Cuffe points out:
<blockquote>
<p>
The populations that least contribute to climate change are bearing the brunt of its impacts.
