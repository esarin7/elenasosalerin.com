#### A weekly edition of things I think you'd like to read, listen to, and watch

So here we are. Friday at last. 2020 has been baffling, existential, and dizzying but this week felt one hell of a sluggish long ride around an endless maze.  

As many of us have been holding our breath waiting for the <span class="thick">U.S. election results</span> this week, life kept unravelling around the world. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/6/central-america-still-on-high-alert-as-hurricane-eta-kills-dozens">hurricane Eta hit <span class="thick">Central America</span></a>, killing dozens, and Al-Jazeera reports its landslides and torrential rains have caused a humanitarian disaster. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that <span class="thick">Ethiopia</span>, Africa's second-most populous country which geostrategic importance is relevant to the African Union, the European Union, the U.S. and Gulf states, seemed to be on <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ethiopia-conflict/ethiopia-sends-army-into-opposition-tigray-region-idUKKBN27K0GX">the brink of a civil war</a> (tensions and military scalation remain), and this Thursday, the Associated Press reported <span class="thick">Kosovo</span>'s president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/05/hashim-thaci-kosovos-president-resigns-to-face-war-crimes-charges-in-the-hague">resigned to face war crimes charges</a> in The Hague.


It feels grim out there. While it's important to remain vigilant, to be informed, and to stay engaged, we need to approach these actions with hope and a clear head. It's okay to pause the <a href="https://twitter.com/karenkho">doomscrolling</a> and turn off the news for a few hours or a day. 

That's why, for this first edition of my weekly roundup, I want to offer thoughtful and hopeful reflections and a couple of creative forms of mental escapism to recalibrate our senses. 

<span role="img" aria-label="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> Be kind to yourself and others. Enjoy your weekend.

#### <span role="img" aria-label="open book">üìñ</span> To Read

<ul class="list">

<li>This <a href="https://the.ink/p/how-to-block-an-autocratic-breakthrough">incredible conversation</a> between Anand Giridharadas and <em>The New Yorker</em>'s brilliant Masha Gessen, who shares relevant reflections like this:
<blockquote>
<p>
Everything is not subtle. Some things are clear; some things are morally abhorrent and have no justification, and then other things are things that call for empathy. Some things are morally abhorrent but require strategic empathy because we still need to understand where they came from. That's where stories come in.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
This solid explainer of <a href="https://futureofgood.co/trumpism-in-canada/"> how the U.S. is influencing Canada's social justice landscape</a>. While sadly far-right extremism, misinformation, and climate change denial are taking hold, there's no evidence that Canadians are becoming more populist. That doesn't meant we should remain complacent.
</li>
</ul>

#### <span role="img" aria-label="ear">üëÇ</span> To Listen

I can't remember the last time I heard a record in its entirety without skipping songs. That wasn't the case with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6JwtB0zzNYy4qANDrJtrJy?utm_source=Newsletter+Radio+Ambulante&utm_campaign=ef0114c24b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_08_06_09_06_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e2fc316930-ef0114c24b-110953113"> Lianne La Havas third and latest album</a>. I enjoyed and keep enjoying every single one of her 12 songs. Her bold and multilayered voice gives Lauren Hill and Nina Simone vibes.
