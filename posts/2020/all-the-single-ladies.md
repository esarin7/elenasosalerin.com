One of the most memorable monologues of the cult BBC drama, Fleabag, states that menopause is the “most wonderful fucking thing in the world.

And yes, <span class="thick">your entire pelvic floor crumbles</span> and you get fucking hot and no one cares. But then – you’re free! *No longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts.* You’re just a person, in business.” 

When an entranced Fleabag says she has been told the whole thing is horrendous, Scott Thomas’s character responds: “It is horrendous, but then it’s magnificent. Something to look forward to.”

#### All the shiny ladies

That scene, viewed about half a million times on YouTube, sticks in the mind because it represented something rare in popular culture; an older female character who actively made younger women want to be just like her.

Some things are worth noting and living out.

"It was the first time I’d ever seen a woman in a film or a book who was frankly hot, talking about it [menopause] as a relief,” says Sam Baker, the former magazine editor whose new book The Shift describes using her own difficult menopause as a springboard to a better life. When Fleabag tries to kiss her, and she’s like: ‘You’re lovely but I can’t be bothered’ – that was brilliant because it captured so much of what’s great about being an older woman; you know what you want, and you’re quite happy to say it.

There are two types of fans:

<ul class="list">
        <li>The happy ones</li>
        <li>The nostalgic ones </li>
</ul>

<ol class="list-numbers">
        <li>The rad ones</li>
        <li>The unique ones </li>
</ol>


#### All the happy ladies
Her own book, she says, was born of puzzlement that even in a taboo-busting #MeToo era, female ageing was still so little discussed.

“My 40s would have been so much better if I’d had someone saying: ‘This is the crap that you’re about to go through, but on the other side is this weird liberation.’”

The top leaders are:

<li>Lady Gladys</li>
<li>Lady Tamara</li>
<li>Lady Ethel</li>
<li>Lady Petra</li>
<li>Lady Beyond It all</li>

At the end what really matters is that everyone has fun and leads a life of fulfillment. Actions that nurture the soul are accumulative and in the long term, they pay off.
