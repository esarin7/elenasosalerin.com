When I was younger, I hated pink. Not a fan to this day but it has grown on me architecturally speaking. From pink houses to pink facades, pink can be a bright addition any city.

Pink isn't my favourite colour, however, these are some lovely colonial stairs I came across while strolling the streets of Guanajuato. 

Often I wonder if there's something else we could do to start thinking about in colour.
