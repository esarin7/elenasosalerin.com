        Hi! <span role="img" aria-label="Waving hand" class="wave">üëã</span></p>
      <p>I'm <span role="img" aria-label="Brunette Woman Technologist" class="Woman technologist">üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</span> Elena.</p>

      <p>
      I'm a first-generation Canadian from Mexico, currently based in<span role="img" aria-label="Round red pushpin" class="red-pin">üìç</span>southern Alberta, Canada, close to the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/big-rock-erratic" target="blank"> world's largest known glacial erratic</a>. 
      </p>

      <p>I combine my professional experiences and knowledge with my creativity and desire for positive change to create meaningful, informative, and motivating work.</p>

      <p>
        With over a decade of professional experience in ten countries across three continents, I've worked as a media and communications specialist for different organizations in the
        humanitarian and international development sectors.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've written about and have managed strategies and digital products on a wide range of topics like human rights and governance, environmental sustainability, HIV education and prevention, press freedom, gender equality, and cooperative agricultural entrepreneurship.
      </p>

      <p>
      I'm responsible for the communications of an international project led by the Ottawa-based organization <a href="https://www.actioncanadashr.org/" target="blank"> Action Canada</a>. It's focused on advacing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights of youth in Latin America and the Caribbean.
      <p>

      <p>
        I'm passionate about harnessing media and communications as tools to
        amplify voice, facilitate meaningful participation, and foster social
        change.
      </p>

      <p>
        I see code as an ideal complement to these tools. It enhances storytelling and makes sense of information in exciting and engaging ways.
